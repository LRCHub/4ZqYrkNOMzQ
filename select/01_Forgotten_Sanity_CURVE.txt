I've forgotten how to write and I'm giving up on speech
I can't remember how I look or the day of the week

Your love is a distant memory along with most of my family
I'd get on my knees but I'm not allowed even though I've forgotten how

I've forgotten how, I've forgotten how
I've forgotten how, I've forgotten how

I've forgotten how to walk and I can't use my hands at all
I'd cross my heart and hope to die but I'm heading for a fall

Just let me go for my sanity, put me out of my misery
I'd get on my knees but I'm not allowed even though I've forgotten how

I've forgotten how, I've forgotten how
I've forgotten how, I've forgotten how
Decay, decay, decay, decay

Your love is a distant memory along with most of my family
I'd get on my knees but I'm not allowed even though I've forgotten how

I've forgotten how, I've forgotten how
I've forgotten how, I've forgotten how

Put me out of my misery, let me go for my sanity
