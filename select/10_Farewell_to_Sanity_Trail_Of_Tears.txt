And shadows embraced me and claimed my heart
Into a fearful story of dark
A soul to forever be torn apart

I'll make your mind into my insanity slave

Carried away by winds of betrayal
I'll lock you up, chain you to aspects of
Chaos, malice and death

[Chorus:]
Can you hear me scream?
Can you see me bleed?
I'm still falling
I'm still crawling

As your heartbeat faded, in panic breath
Brutal reflections in hysterical ways
A view of desperation is nailed to your face
I hide and disappear, just to haunt you once again

[Chorus:]
Can you hear me scream?
Can you see me bleed?
I'm still falling
I'm still crawling
Please release me
You are nothing to save
Will you leave me
You are lost in yourself
Please heal me

While your eyes are still open
Hypnotized by fear
I'll swaddle your slowly into my crib of pain
To a universe of everlasting immortal dark
Your soul I've claimed
Now it's mine to tear apart

You made me into your own insanity slave
Of chaos, malice and death

Carried away by winds of betrayal

[Chorus:]
Can you hear me scream?
Can you see me bleed?
I'm still falling
I'm still crawling
Please release me
You are nothing to save
Will you leave me
You are lost in yourself
Please heal me
