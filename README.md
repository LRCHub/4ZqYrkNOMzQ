# Louis Tomlinson – Sanity

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I got my sanity
It's only me and nobody
I know you're mad at me
I don't know what to say
I got my sanity
It's only me and nobody
I got my sanity
Guess I've been numbing myself
A little too much
And thinking it helps
But now that my mind
is finally clear
I'm letting you slide
No distortion now
I know you're not listening so
I keep talking
To myself
To myself
To myself
I got my sanity
It's only me and nobody
I know you're mad at me
I don't know what to say
I got my sanity
It's only me and nobody
If you're not listening
Then I'll keep talking
To myself
To myself
To myself
I got my sanity
My sanity
To myself
To myself
To myself
I got my sanity
My sanity
Finally sane
Now I got myself
out the way
Healing what is left
of my brain
Time I got is mine
No distortion now
I know you're not listening so
I keep talking
To myself
To myself
To myself
I got my sanity
It's only me and nobody
I know you're mad at me
I don't know what to say
I got my sanity
It's only me and nobody
If you're not listening
Then I'll keep talking
To myself
To myself
To myself
I got my sanity
My sanity
To myself
To myself
To myself
I got my sanity
My sanity
